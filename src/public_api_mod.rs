//! public_api_mod gives more control over changes in the public api.
//!
//! The Public API of a library is a pain in the a...  
//! Every time I modify something I have to think how it will affect the users of the library.  
//! They could have tens or hundreds of places where they use the library. Breaking changes are terrible things.  
//! The developers are not willing to change their code every time a library changes slightly.  
//! Yes, there is the semver to show if the new library is API compatible. That helps a lot.  
//! It is dreaded if the first version of a function does not return a Result<>.  
//! Then later we will surely come to the point, that we need to return a Result<>. This is a terrible breaking change.  
//! It is wise to return a Result always. Even when that is not needed right now. It will surely be needed in the future.  
//! Another tactic is to make new functions with a different name and mark the old functions as Obsolete.
//!
//! This library is used by the automation_tasks_rs executable.  
//! I want to have here the complete and exact definition of the public API.  
//! Therefore I will not use reexports like `pub use` or `pub mod`.  
//! This way I can always know easily if my public API has changed.  
//! Just compare the `public_api_mod.rs` file in git diff.  
//! Adding functions, structs, methods and enums is ok, it does not break the Public API.  
//! But modifying existing functions, methods or enums will break the compatibility.
